Tool similar to howdoi. Was supposed to work as a plugin for sublimetext editor
=====================

The program's purpose was to evaluate the usefulness of a tool for programmers. The target user groups were people who
-forgot certain snippets of code
-don't want to browse web to do Stackoverflow search
-scientists from various fields who would like to search for useful software patterns
-beginners
They can do it directly in the text editor with this plugin.

Notes:
At the moment it looks like the github3.py library is the best for interfacing with the Github APIv3:

For mining Stackoverflow for code we are currently using the Py-Stackexchange open-source library

Github API queries should be placed in the GithubQueries file

<h4>Should move all the paper notes here</h4>
